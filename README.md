# Wolf's Knitting and book library

This is the frontend of my Full-satack project.

It initially started off as just a hub for knitting patterns, where you can add and delete them from your library. But progressed to include a book library for the Warhammer 30k book series, which also has an add and remove functionallity. 

the piece of code I am most pleased with is my switch case that changes the nav bar and dashboard based on the link clicked and also refreshes the page to implement this change.

## Plans
- I need to fix the cloud error that I have encountered that prevents the data from being displayed on the library pages. I feel this may take some time due to not knowing what has caused the error. The fetch method has not changed and it was working prior.
- I need to finish the pattern page that is accessed through a link on the pattern card in the library, fixing the cloud error first will help with styling how the page appears when the link is clicked.
- I want to have a look at the layout and design of the whole project to see if there are areas that I can improve to make the whole thing look better.
